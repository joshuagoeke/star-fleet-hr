## Description

Building this app gave me the opportunity to learn about using Node.js to build a SQL database management system using MySQL and Inquirer. I also am gaining an appreciation for the usefulness of express routes and modularization in the app file systems, because the index.js file is rather large. I plan to fix this in future iterations!

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
WHEN I choose to view all departments
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
WHEN I choose to view all roles
THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
WHEN I choose to view all employees
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
WHEN I choose to add a department
THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add a role
THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add an employee
THEN I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
WHEN I choose to update an employee role
THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database 
```
We were also given this schema chart:

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)

## Installation

Be sure after downloading and unzipping the directory to run in your integrated terminal or command prompt in the appropriate directory:

- (install mysql2 and node.js if you have not already done so)
- in the root folder (same location as package.json), run ```npm i```
- ```cd db```
- log into mysql with ```mysql -u root -p```, enter your password, and then run ```SOURCE schema.sql;```
- still in mysql: run ```SOURCE seeds.sql;```
- quit mysql with ```quit```
- ```cd ..``` to get back to the root folder
- start Starfleet HR with ```node index.js```


## Usage

Once the program is operating in the terminal, follow the prompts to answer questions to view various tables, add, or change information for employees.
